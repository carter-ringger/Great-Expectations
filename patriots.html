        <div class="chunk">By Carter Ringger | Updated on 15 April, 2023</div>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Football is a multi-faceted game, in which a great deal of strategy 
            and gameplanning, in addition to practice, must be involved to achieve 
            proper on-field execution. All my life, the New England Patriots
            have been a symbol of dominance in the National Football League. Only in 
            years following the separation of coach Bill Belichick and quarterback 
            Tom Brady have I actually begun to appreciate their two decades of supremacy. 
            While the players take the stage at the end of the day, I have found myself 
            incredibly inspired by the dedication great coaches require of themselves. 
            Stories began to come out after the Brady-Belichick split. I was amazed my 
            the remarkable level of commitment demonstrated by these two men, specifically
            Bill Belichick. </p>
        <p><span class="tab"></span>Bill was both the last guy out of the building at night and the guy in his office 
            at 4am the following morning. Bill developed compreghensive files, not just of 
            the opposing players, but of the opposing coaches. He sought to master the game
            within the game by gathering information on their schemes, coaching philosophies, 
            and tendencies in game-time situations. Players and coashing assistants alike have 
            often lauded Bill for his attention to detail. Many corroborated stories recall 
            Bill predicting how a game would unfold the following day, quarter by quarter. He'd
            follow his breakdown with further details on a gameplan that would minimize 
            opponent strengths while maximizing theirs. Not only was Bill coaching the dynasty 
            of the 2000s and 2010s during the regular season, but he also served as the team's 
            general manager, scouting the collegiate landscape for potential roster additions.</p> 
        <p><span class="tab"></span> Brady left the Patriots a year before I left for college and the Patriot influence 
            became more apparent throughout my senior year, as I applied many of Belichickian 
            principles to overcome personal hurdles. This interest grew as I moved off to college.
            I entered a competitive environment in BYU, an environment that could be very lonely. 
            Jeff Benedict's 
                <span class = "ibtbf">The Dynasty</span> and Seth Wickersham's 
                <span class = "ibtbf">It's Better to be Feared</span> were scriptures to a young boy
            trying to develop an identity away from home. Entering my sophmore year, wearing a 
            Patriots sweatshirt with cut-off sleeves has come to mean far more than simply showing 
            team support; a mere change in attire was a reminder of my personal and conceptual 
            conversion to the principles of Patriot way. </p><br>

<p>Below is a recorded edition of Tom Brady's return to Gillette Statium to play against the New England Patriots. 
    I return occasionally to appreciate the greatness witnessed here, wherein two of the greatest football minds went head-to-head.</p>

        <h2 id="opa">What does the Patriot Way represent?</h2>
    </div>
            <p> I've never been able to adequately explain what the New England Patriots, or the Patriot Way, 
                means to me personally. Below, I tried to summarize this deeply-heled 
                personal belief into three words:
            </p>

                            <li>Focusing on the details; Apply a fine-tooth comb</li>
                            <li>Finding ways to improve; Learning, regardless of outcome</li>
                            <li>Maintaining situational awareness</li>
                            <li>Accepting Accountability</li>
                            <li>Studying opponents schematic and personal tendencies</li>

                            <li>Increasing intelligence</li>
                            <li>Continuing to fight, despite the odds</li>
                            <li>Not caring about the outside noise</li>
                            <li>Developing one’s cerebral nature</li>
